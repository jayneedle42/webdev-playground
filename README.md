I am building a website to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website is always a work in progress. I use this repository to test features and implement new ideas.

[VIEW WEBSITE HERE](https://webdev-playground.onrender.com/)

## Current Features
- Responsive - Adjusts seamlessly from mobile to desktop
- Sticky Header
- Unique Icon Menu
- Photo Grid
- Photo Zoom Overlay
- Social Media Sticky
- Hover and Flip Card Animation
- Custom "Bang" Revolver Cursor (Because it's fun!)
- [Pixel Art Canvas Web App](https://webdev-playground.onrender.com/pixelart.html)

**PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

More updates coming soon....
