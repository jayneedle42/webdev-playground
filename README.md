I am building a personal website to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently it only features a home page of my illustration portfolio. More coming soon!

## Current Features
- Responsive to adjust from mobile to dekstop
- Sticky Header
- Unique Icon Menu
- Photo Grid
- Photo Zoom Overlay
- Social Media Sticky
- Custom "Bang" Revolver Cursor (Because it's fun!)

**PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**
